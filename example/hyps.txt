28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he cannot imagine anyone who would want to harm him,"Finally, it went uphill again at him."
The corpse, found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the Justice Department said in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is on the running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who formerly worked as a cook in Boston, had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we are going to miss him painfully," said the spokesman.
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time at Franks's family and friends.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
